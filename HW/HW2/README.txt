I referenced the examples and in class programming assignments
and primarily used the following websites:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/

As well as other online searches.

I didn't work with any classmates or any tutors.

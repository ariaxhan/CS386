Create the following JavaScript code:
    Declare two variables named op1 and op2 and assign floating point numbers to them
    Perform the addition of those two variables and store result in variable sum
    Perform the subtraction of those two variables and store result in variable diff
    Perform the division of those two variables and store result in variable quotient
    Perform the multiplication of those two variables and store result in variable product
    Output the results in the console using template strings as shown below:
